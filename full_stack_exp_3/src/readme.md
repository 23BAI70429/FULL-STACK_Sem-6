Experiment–3: Multi-Page College Management System using React Router
📌 Project Title

College Management System – Multi-Page React Application

🎯 Objective

The objective of this experiment is to extend the previously developed web page (Experiment–2) by:

Implementing React Router

Creating multiple pages in a React application

Maintaining consistent UI across pages

Enhancing structure and navigation in a Single Page Application (SPA)

🧩 Project Description

This project is an extension of the College Management System developed in Experiment–2.

In this experiment:

A second page named Departments was added.

React Router was implemented for seamless navigation.

Navigation between pages happens without reloading the browser.

UI consistency is maintained across all pages.

The application now contains:

🏠 Home Page

🏫 Departments Page

🛠️ Technologies Used

React.js (Vite Setup)

React Router DOM

Bootstrap

React Icons

HTML5

CSS3

JavaScript (ES6)

🚀 Key Features

Multi-page navigation using React Router

Clean and modern responsive UI

Fixed navbar across pages

Animated gradient hero sections

Interactive department cards with hover effects

Component-based architecture

Consistent layout structure
